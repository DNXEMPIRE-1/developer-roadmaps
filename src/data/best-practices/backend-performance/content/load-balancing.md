# Load Balancing for Traffic Distribution

The performance of a backend system in web applications hugely relies on the way it handles incoming traffic. If a server is overwhelmed with too much traffic, it may slow down significantly or, in the worst-case scenario, crash completely. Opting to use load balancing mitigates these risks. Load balancing involves distributing network traffic across multiple servers, thereby ensuring none is overwhelmed. This undoubtedly optimizes backend performance, maintaining system stability, and increasing the capacity to handle more traffic. For instance, high traffic websites like Amazon and Facebook use load balancers to evenly distribute millions of requests per day among countless servers, ensuring smooth and efficient service delivery.
