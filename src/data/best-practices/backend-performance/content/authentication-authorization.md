# Implementing Proper Authentication and Authorization

In the backend performance of web applications, robust authentication and authorization play an integral role. Having tight security measures ensures the application's optimal functioning by preventing unauthorized access. These precautionary measures protect the system from external threats such as data breaches or malicious attacks. For example, imagine a banking application without stringent authentication procedures. It could be easily exploited by hackers, leading to serious loss of finances and damage to the bank's reputation. Therefore, secure authentication and authorization is essential for maintaining the application's integrity and stability, ultimately contributing to efficient backend performance.
