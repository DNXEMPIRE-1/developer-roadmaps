# Offloading Heavy Tasks to Background Jobs or Queues

In web applications, backend performance can be significantly optimized through the offloading of heavy tasks to background jobs or queues. If significant computational tasks or resource-intensive operations are processed in real-time, there can be a considerable slowdown in the systemâ€™s response time. This can lead to an undesirable user experience as requests take longer to process. In contrast, moving these heavy tasks to background processes allows for a more streamlined and efficient operation. For instance, creating a thumbnail for an uploaded image or sending a confirmation email could be moved to a background job, leaving the main thread free to handle user requests. This way, the user wouldn't have to wait unnecessarily and could continue navigating the website seamlessly, hence, improving overall system performance and responsiveness.
