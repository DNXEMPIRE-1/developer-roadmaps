# Regular Auditing and Updating Security Measures

Securing the backend of your web application is paramount to maintaining peak performance. If a system is compromised due to outdated security measures, hackers could leverage this access to disrupt the performance of the site. For instance, an attacker may deploy a DDoS attack, rendering the service slow or completely unavailable. By conducting regular audits and updates of security measures, possible vulnerabilities can be identified and solved before they turn into larger performance affecting issues. This proactive approach supports stable operation, ensures smooth access for users, and promotes overall backend performance.
