# Hosting Backend Close to Users to Minimize Network Latency

In web applications, reducing network latency can substantially enhance the backend performance. This means data has less distance to travel between users and servers, resulting in faster response times and smoother user experiences. For instance, if a company's primary user base resides in Asia but its server is in North America, the geographical gap can cause noticeable delays. However, by situating the backend near this Asia-based user base, data doesn't have to cross oceans and continents, making interactive web services more responsive and reliable. Hence, hosting the backend location close to the users is a crucial strategy in minimizing network latency.
