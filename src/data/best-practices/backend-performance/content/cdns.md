# Utilization of CDNs for Static and Frequently Accessed Assets

For optimal backend performance in web applications, the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for serving static and frequently accessed assets is paramount. CDNs enhance website loading speed by storing a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations. As such, when a user requests a website, the content is delivered from the nearest server, dramatically reducing latency and packet loss. This is especially beneficial for static and frequently accessed assets that remain unchanged over time like CSS, JavaScript files or Image files. For instance, a user in London trying to access a US-based web application can retrieve static content from a closer server in the UK rather than crossing the Atlantic every time, ensuring efficient and speedy content delivery.
