  - question: What is Node.js?
    answer: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

  - question: What is REPL in Node.js?
    answer: |
      REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. It is an interactive shell that allows you to execute JavaScript code and view the output immediately. It is useful for testing small snippets of code and experimenting with the Node.js API.

  - question: What is Event Loop in Node.js?
    answer: |
      The event loop is a single-threaded loop responsible for handling all asynchronous tasks in Node.js. It continuously checks for events and executes associated callback functions, allowing Node.js to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently. Its non-blocking I/O model ensures that it can process multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for one to complete before moving on to the next, contributing to its scalability and performance.

  - question: What are modules in Node.js?
    answer: |
      Modules are reusable blocks of code that can be imported into other files. They are used to encapsulate related code into a single unit of code that can be used in other parts of the program. It allow us to split our code into multiple files and reuse it across multiple files. Some built-in modules include `fs`, `http`, `path`, `url`, `util`, etc.

  - question: What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?
    answer: |
      `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` are both used to schedule a callback function to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop. The difference is that `process.nextTick()` executes the callback at the end of the current iteration of the event loop, while `setImmediate()` executes the callback at the beginning of the next iteration of the event loop.

  - question: How to read a file in Node.js?
    answer: |
      The `fs.readFile()` method is used to read the contents of a file asynchronously. It takes the path of the file to be read and a callback function as arguments. The callback function is called with two arguments, `err` and `data`. If an error occurs while reading the file, the `err` argument will contain the error object. Otherwise, the `data` argument will contain the contents of the file.

      The `fork` method is used when you want to run another JavaScript file in a separate worker. It's like having a friend with a specific task. You can communicate with them via messages and they can send messages back to you. The `spawn` method is used when you want to run a command in a separate process. It's like asking someone to do a specific. You can communicate with them via stdin/stdout/stderr, but it's more like giving orders and getting results.

      Memory leaks happen when a program allocates memory but does not release it when it is no longer needed. This can happen due to bugs in the program or due to the way the program is designed. In Node.js, memory leaks can happen due to the use of closures, circular references, and global variables.
