# Data Engineering Fundamentals

Data Engineering is essentially dealing with the collection, validation, storage, transformation, and processing of data. The objective is to provide reliable, efficient, and scalable data pipelines and infrastructure that allow data scientists to convert data into actionable insights. It involves steps like data ingestion, data storage, data processing, and data provisioning. Important concepts include designing, building, and maintaining data architecture, databases, processing systems, and large-scale processing systems. It is crucial to have extensive technical knowledge in various tools and programming languages like SQL, Python, Hadoop, and more.
