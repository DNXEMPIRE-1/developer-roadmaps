# Data lakes & Warehouses

"**Data Lakes** are large-scale data repository systems that store raw, untransformed data, in various formats, from multiple sources. They're often used for big data and real-time analytics requirements. Data lakes preserve the original data format and schema which can be modified as necessary. On the other hand, **Data Warehouses** are data storage systems which are designed for analyzing, reporting and integrating with transactional systems. The data in a warehouse is clean, consistent, and often transformed to meet wide-range of business requirements. Hence, data warehouses provide structured data but require more processing and management compared to data lakes."
