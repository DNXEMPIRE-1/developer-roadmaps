# Average 

The average, also often referred to as the mean, is one of the most commonly used mathematical calculations in data analysis. It provides a simple, useful measure of a set of data. For a data analyst, understanding how to calculate and interpret averages is fundamental. Basic functions, including the average, are integral components in data analysis that are used to summarize and understand complex data sets. Though conceptually simple, the power of average lies in its utility in a range of analyses - from forecasting models to understanding trends and patterns in the dataset.
