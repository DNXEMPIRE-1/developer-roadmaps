# Min / Max Function

Understanding the minimum and maximum values in your dataset is critical in data analysis. These basic functions, often referred to as Min-Max functions, are statistical tools that data analysts use to inspect the distribution of a particular dataset. By identifying the lowest and highest values, data analysts can gain insight into the range of the dataset, identify possible outliers, and understand the data's variability. Beyond their use in descriptive statistics, Min-Max functions also play a vital role in data normalization, shaping the accuracy of predictive models in Machine Learning and AI fields.
