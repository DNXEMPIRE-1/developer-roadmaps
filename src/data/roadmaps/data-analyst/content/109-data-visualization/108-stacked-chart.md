# Stacked Chart 

A stacked chart is an essential tool for a data analyst in the field of data visualization. This type of chart presents quantitative data in a visually appealing manner and allows users to easily compare different categories while still being able to compare the total sizes. These charts are highly effective when trying to measure part-to-whole relationships, displaying accumulated totals over time or when presenting data with multiple variables. Data analysts often use stacked charts to detect patterns, trends and anomalies which can aid in strategic decision making.
