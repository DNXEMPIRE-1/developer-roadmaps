# Data Visualization Libraries

Data visualization is a critical part of any data analysis process. It allows data analysts to understand complex data sets by converting a myriad of numbers into engaging, meaningful visuals. Data visualization libraries are toolkits enabling this transformation. They consist of pre-built functions and methods to create visuals such as graphs, charts, maps, and many more from raw data. This gives data analysts the capacity to present their findings in an insightful, easy-to-understand manner for stakeholders. Popular libraries include `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, and `Bokeh` in Python, and `ggplot2` in R, each varying in their features, complexity, and flexibility.
