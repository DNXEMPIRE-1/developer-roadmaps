# Removing Duplicates

In the world of data analysis, a critical step is data cleaning, that includes an important sub-task: removing duplicate entries. Duplicate data can distort the results of data analysis by giving extra weight to duplicate instances and leading to biased or incorrect conclusions. Despite the quality of data collection, there's a high probability that datasets may contain duplicate records due to various factors like human error, merging datasets, etc. Therefore, data analysts must master the skill of identifying and removing duplicates to ensure that their analysis is based on a unique, accurate, and diverse set of data. This process contributes to more accurate predictions and inferences, thus maximizing the insights gained from the data.
