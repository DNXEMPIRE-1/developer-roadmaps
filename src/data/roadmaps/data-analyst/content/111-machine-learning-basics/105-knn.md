# KNN 

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful algorithm used in the field of machine learning, which a Data Analyst might employ for tasks such as classification or regression. It works based on the principle of proximity, where the prediction of new instance's category depends upon the category of its nearest neighbors. For a Data Analyst working with complex data sets, it's crucial to understand how the KNN algorithm operates, its applicability, pros, and cons. This will facilitate making well-informed decisions about when to utilize it for the best possible outcome in data analysis.
