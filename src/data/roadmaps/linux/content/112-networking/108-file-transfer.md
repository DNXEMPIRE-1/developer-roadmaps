# Linux File Transfer under Networking

In Linux, file transfer is an act of copying or moving a file from one computer to another over a network connection. This concept is essential for system administrators and end-users who require the ability to share files between systems or networks.

Linux provides several command-line tools and applications for network-based file transfers. These tools support various standard protocols such as FTP, HTTP, SCP, SFTP, and NFS. Some of the most well-known commands for file transfer include `scp`, `rsync`, and `wget`.

For instance, when transferring a file from a local machine to a remote server, the `scp` command can be utilized as follows:
```bash
scp /path/to/local/file username@remote:/path/to/destination
```
This command would copy the file to the designated remote system.

Understanding and efficiently using these tools can make the task of file sharing over networks streamlined, easier, and more secure.
