# TCP/IP 

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) forms the backbone of internet protocols. Essentially, it is a set of networking protocols that allows two or more computers to communicate. In the context of Linux, TCP/IP networking is a fundamental part of the operating system's functionality. It provides a platform for establishing connections and facilitating data transfer between two endpoints.

TCP/IP serves a vital role in enabling a host, given a correct IP configuration, to connect and interact with other hosts on the same or different networks. It is comprised of a four layers model, including the Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application layers. Understanding TCP/IP, its structure and how it works are crucial for effectively managing and troubleshooting Linux networks. 

Below is a basic command using TCP/IP protocol in Linux:

```bash
# To view all active TCP/IP network connections
netstat -at
```
