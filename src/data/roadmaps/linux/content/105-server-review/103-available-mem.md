# Evaluating Available Memory

When running several applications in a Linux environment, constant tracking of system health is crucial for smooth operations. Evaluating available memory as part of a server review is a common practice for system administrators. This involves using various command-line tools provided by Linux, such as `free`, `vmstat`, and `top`. These can assist in monitoring memory usage and performance metrics, ensuring systems are not overloaded, and adequate resources are available for important applications.

The `free` command, for instance, gives a summary of the overall memory usage including total used and free memory, swap memory and buffer/cache memory. Here's an example:

```bash
$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           15Gi       10Gi       256Mi       690Mi       5.3Gi       4.2Gi
Swap:         8.0Gi       1.3Gi       6.7Gi
```

In this output, the '-h' option is used to present the results in a human-readable format. Understanding the state of memory usage in your Linux server can help maintain optimal server performance and troubleshoot any potential issues.
