# Server Review 

The process of reviewing a server in Linux involves assessing the server's performance, security, and configuration to identify areas of improvement or any potential issues. The scope of the review can include checking security enhancements, examining log files, reviewing user accounts, analyzing the serverâ€™s network configuration, and checking its software versions.

Linux, known for its stability and security, has become a staple on the back-end of many networks and servers worldwide. Depending on the distribution you are using, Linux offers multiple tools and commands to perform comprehensive server reviews.

```bash
# A command often used for showing memory information
free -m

# A command for showing disk usage
df -h

# A command for showing CPU load
uptime
```

It is a critical task for System Administrators and DevOps professionals to routinely conduct server reviews to ensure the server's optimal performance, security, and reliability.
