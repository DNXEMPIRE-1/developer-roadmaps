# Booting Linux

Booting Linux refers to the process that the Linux operating system undergoes when a computer system is powered on. When you switch on your device, the system bootloader is loaded into the main memory from a fixed location to start the main operating system. 

The whole process involves several stages including POST (Power-On Self Test), MBR (Master Boot Record), GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), Kernel, Init process, and finally the GUI or command line interface where users interact. 

During this process, vital system checks are executed, hardware is detected, appropriate drivers are loaded, filesystems are mounted, necessary system processes are started, and finally, the user is presented with a login prompt.

Here is an example of the GRUB configuration file `/etc/default/grub` which is used to configure the GRUB bootloader options:

```bash
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```
This is a basic introduction to booting Linux. However, the specifics may vary depending on the Linux distribution and the specific configurations of your system.
