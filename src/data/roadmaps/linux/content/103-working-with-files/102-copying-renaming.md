# Copying and Renaming Files 

In Linux, working with files is a daily operation. Whether you are a system administrator, a developer or a regular user, there are tasks where you need to copy, rename, or perform similar actions with files and directories.

To copy files, we utilize the `cp` command. It stands for "copy" and operates on two primary arguments: the file you want to copy and the location where you want it copied. For instance:

```bash
cp /path/to/original/file /path/to/copied/file
```

On the other hand, to rename or move files, we use the `mv` command. The `mv` command stands for "move". Similar to the `cp` command, it operates on two arguments being the file you want to rename or move and the file or directory you want to rename or move it to. This would look something like:

```bash
mv /path/to/original/file /path/to/new/file
```

Remember that Linux commands are case sensitive so make sure to enter the commands exactly as they are.
