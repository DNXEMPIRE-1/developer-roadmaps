# Container Runtime 

Container runtime in Linux refers to the software that is responsible for running containers. Each container runtime provides specific features and benefits, with common capabilities including image transport and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level network and volume interactions, and more.

Under Linux, popular container runtime options include:

- Docker: Docker is probably the most common container runtime, featuring an excellent ecosystem and superb community support.
- Containerd: Originally developed as a high-level container runtime layer to be used in Docker, Containerd is now often used as a standalone runtime.
- CRI-O: A lightweight container runtime specifically optimized for Kubernetes.

In containerization, understanding the role of container runtime is integral as it helps in better designing and running your containerized applications. This further ensures reliability and efficient use of resources. Each container runtime can be suited for different use cases so it's best to understand their pros and cons to use them effectively.
