# Head Command 

The `head` command in Linux is a text processing utility that allows a user to output the first part (or the "head") of files. It is commonly used for previewing the start of a file without loading the entire document into memory, which can act as an efficient way of quickly examining the data in very large files. By default, the `head` command prints the first 10 lines of each file to standard output, which is the terminal in most systems.

```bash
head file.txt
```
The number of output lines can be customized using an option. For example, to display first 5 lines, we use `-n` option followed by the number of lines:

```bash
head -n 5 file.txt
```
