# join Command in Text Processing on Linux

`join` is a powerful text processing command in Linux. It lets you combine lines of two files on a common field, which works similar to the 'Join' operation in SQL. It's particularly useful when you're dealing with large volumes of data. Specifically, `join` uses the lines from two files to form lines that contain pairs of lines related in a meaningful way.

For instance, if you have two files that have a list of items, one with costs and the other with quantities, you can use `join` to combine these two files so each item has a cost and quantity on the same line.

```bash
# Syntax
join file1.txt file2.txt
```

Please note that `join` command works properly only when the files are sorted.
