# Paste

In Linux, paste is a powerful text processing utility that is primarily used for merging lines from multiple files. It allows users to combine data by columns rather than rows, adding immense flexibility to textual data manipulation. Users can choose a specific delimiter for separating columns, providing a range of ways to format the output.

A common use case of the paste command in Linux is the combination of two text files into one, like shown in the example snippet below. 

```bash
paste file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```

Over the years, this command has proved to be critical in Linux file processing tasks due to its efficiency, and simplicity.
