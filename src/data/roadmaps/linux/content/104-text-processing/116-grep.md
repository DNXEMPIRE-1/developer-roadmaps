# GREP in Text Processing

GREP (Global Regular Expression Print) is considered a significant tool in text processing area on Unix-like operating systems including Linux. It is a powerful utility that searches and filters text matching a given pattern. When it identifies a line that matches the pattern, it prints the line to the screen, offering an effective and a codified way to find text within files.

An essential part of many shell scripts, bash commands, and command-line operations, GREP is a versatile tool that comes pre-installed with every Linux distribution. It embodies three main parts - format, action and regex. Over the years, it had been effectively utilized in multiple programming languages and data science applications.

Here is an example of a simple GREP command:

```bash
grep "pattern" fileName
```

This command will search for the specified pattern within the file and prints the line to the terminal.
