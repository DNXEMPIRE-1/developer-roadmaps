# Understanding Directory Hierarchy 

In Linux, understanding the directory hierarchy is crucial for efficient navigation and file management. A Linux system's directory structure, also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and instead organise them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner. 

Each directory serves a specific purpose. For instance, `/bin` holds binary executable files (command files), `/etc` has system configuration files, `/home` stores users' personal files, and `/var` contains varying files such as logs and print queues.

No code snippet is necessary as understanding directory hierarchy is a conceptual knowledge and doesn't involve code execution.
