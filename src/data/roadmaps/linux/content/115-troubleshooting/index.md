# Troubleshooting 

Troubleshooting is an essential skill for any Linux user or administrator. This involves identifying and resolving problems or issues within a Linux system. These problems can range from common system errors, hardware or software issues, network connectivity problems, to management of system resources. The process of troubleshooting in Linux often involves the use of command-line tools, inspecting system and application log files, understanding system processes, and sometimes, deep diving into the Linux kernel.

The key to effective troubleshooting is understanding how Linux works and being familiar with the common command-line tools. Also, being able to interpret error messages, use Linux's built-in debugging tools, and understand common problem symptoms can speed up resolution time.

The `top` command is a commonly used troubleshooting tool that provides a dynamic, real-time view of the processes running on a system. It can be particularly useful for identifying resource-heavy processes that could be causing performance issues.
