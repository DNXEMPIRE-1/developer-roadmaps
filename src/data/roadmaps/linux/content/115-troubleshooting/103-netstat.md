# Netstat 

Netstat, short for network statistics, is a built-in command-line tool used in Linux systems for network troubleshooting and performance measurement.  It provides statistics for protocols, a list of open ports, routing table information, and other important network details. Administrators and developers work with netstat to examine network issues and understand how a system communicates with others.

Its functionality is extended owing to various command-line options it supports, which could be used singularly or combinedly to fine-tune the output. These might include displaying numerical addresses instead of names (`-n`), continuous monitoring (`-c`), or spotting connections on a specific protocol (`-t`, `-u`). 

Here is a brief snippet of how netstat may typically be used:

```bash
# List all connections with numerical values.
netstat -n
```
