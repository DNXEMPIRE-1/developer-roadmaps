# Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. Instead, it provides flexibility by requiring you to choose and integrate the best libraries for your project's needs.
