# Integers

In Rust, integers are a primitive data type that hold whole number values, both positive and negative. Integer types in Rust can be divided into signed and unsigned ones:

- Signed integers, denoted by "i", are those that can hold negative, zero, and positive values
- Unsigned integers, denoted by "u" only hold zero and positive values.

Each denotation is followed by a number which represents the number of bits they occupy in memory. The available integer types are:

|Type|Minimum|Maximum|
|---|---|---|
|i8|-(2^7)|(2^7)-1|
|i16|-(2^15)|(2^15)-1|
|i32|-(2^31)|(2^31)-1|
|i64|-(2^63)|(2^63)-1|
|i128|-(2^127)|(2^127)-1)
|isize|-(2^31) or -(2^63)|(2^31)-1 or (2^63)-1|

The unsigned integer types consist of:

|Type|Minimum|Maximum|
|---|---|---|
|u8|0|(2^8)-1|
|u16|0|(2^16)-1|
|u32|0|(2^32)-1|
|u64|0|(2^64)-1|
|u128|0|(2^128)-1|
|usize|0|(2^32)-1 or (2^64)-1|

In these types, the number after "i" or "u" denotes the size of the integer type in bits.

There're also the `isize` and  the `usize` integer types. The sizes of these primitive are taken from the computer architecture (32/64 bits). When one these types is declared, the compiler calculate, so to speak, how many bytes it takes to reference any location in memory. For example, on a 32 bit target, this is 4 bytes and on a 64 bit target, this is 8 bytes.
