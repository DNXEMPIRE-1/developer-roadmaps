# Identity Verification

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) requires users to verify their identities to ensure they own the email addresses or domains they plan to use as 'From', 'Source', 'Sender', or 'Return-Path' addresses. The verification process prevents unauthorized use of identities. There are two types of identities to verify, email address, and domain. Verifying an email address allows you to send emails from that address. If you verify a domain, you can send emails from any address on that domain. Moreover, while sending an email, the 'From' or 'Return-Path' address must be a verified email or domain.
