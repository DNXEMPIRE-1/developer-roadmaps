# Sandbox / Sending Limits

In AWS SES, when your account is in the sandbox (default mode for all new accounts), you can only send emails to verified email addresses and the maximum send rate is 1 email per second. The maximum sending quota is 200 messages per 24-hour period. To move out of this sandbox environment and increase your sending limits, you will need to request a sending limit increase. This is achieved by submitting an SES Sending Limit Increase case in the AWS Support Center. For more details, one can refer to the AWS SES documentation.
