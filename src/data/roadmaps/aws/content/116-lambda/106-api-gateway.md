# API Gateway

AWS API Gateway is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, like workloads running on Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, or any web application. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, throttling, and API version management. It provides robust, native capabilities to deliver the API governance and lifecycle management capabilities your business needs to productize its APIs.
