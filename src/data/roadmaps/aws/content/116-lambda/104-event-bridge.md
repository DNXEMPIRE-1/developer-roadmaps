# Event Bridge / Scheduled Execution

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. It enables you to build a bridge between your applications, regardless of where they are. With EventBridge, you simply ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events. It simplifies the process of ingesting and delivering events across your application architecture, while also handling event management. EventBridge combines all of the functionality of CloudWatch Events with new and enhanced features.
