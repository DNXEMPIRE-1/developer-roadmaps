# Capacity Settings

Amazon DynamoDB capacity settings refer to the read and write capacity of your tables. The read capacity unit is a measure of the number of strong consistent reads per second, while the write capacity unit is a measure of the number of writes per second. You can set up these capacities either as provisioned or on-demand. Provisioned capacity is where you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you expect your application to require. On the other hand, on-demand capacity allows DynamoDB to automatically manage your read and write capacity to meet the needs of your workload.
