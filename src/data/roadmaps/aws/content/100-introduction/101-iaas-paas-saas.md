# IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

"IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three types of cloud service models. **IaaS** or Infrastructure as a Service provides users with a resource-based service via virtualization technology, offering computing infrastructure, physical or (more often) virtual machines and other resources. **PaaS** or Platform as a Service provides runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applications, it is utilized for software development and offers a platform to developers to build applications and services over the internet. **SaaS** or Software as a Service provides on-demand software accessed via the internet, it delivers a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider."
