# Buckets / Objects

In AWS S3, a "bucket" is a container for data. It is used to store objects. The objects include files or, more technically, any type of data that can be stored in the form of files. In terms of hierarchy, buckets are at the top level in AWS S3. Inside these buckets, you can store any number of objects. An object consists of a file and optionally any metadata that describes that file. It's important to note that you can also store folders within these buckets and inside these folders, you can again store objects. Object keys are unique within a bucket and they help in identifying and retrieving the object.
