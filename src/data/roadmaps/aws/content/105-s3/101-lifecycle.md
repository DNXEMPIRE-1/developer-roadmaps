# Bucket / Object Lifecycle

AWS S3 Lifecycle is a feature within the AWS S3 resources that allows users to manage their objects so that they are automatically transferred to different storage classes or expire at the end of their lifetimes. It facilitates transitioning objects between different storage classes at set times or according to specified conditions, and can also automate the cleanup of expired objects to help reduce storage consumed by obsolete data. A lifecycle can be applied to a bucket or a subset of objects. Note that each transition or expiration activity is a separate action within the lifecycle.
