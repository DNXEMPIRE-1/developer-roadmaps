# Storage Types

Amazon S3 provides three storage classes: S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, and S3 Glacier. `S3 Standard` is designed for frequently accessed data. It delivers low latency and high throughput. `S3 Intelligent-Tiering` is automated storage class that optimizes costs. It moves objects between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based on changing access patterns. `S3 Glacier` is for long-term backup and archives. It has two retrieval modes: Expedited (for quick access) and Bulk (for largest and less time-sensitive retrievals).
