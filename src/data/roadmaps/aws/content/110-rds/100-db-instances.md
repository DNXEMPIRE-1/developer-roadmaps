# DB Instances

The term "DB Instance" is used within the context of Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS). A DB Instance is essentially an isolated database environment in the cloud, run within Amazon RDS. A DB Instance can contain multiple user-created databases, and can be accessed using the same tools and applications that you might use with a stand-alone database instance. You can create and manage a DB Instance via the AWS Management Console, the AWS RDS Command Line Interface, or through simple API calls.
