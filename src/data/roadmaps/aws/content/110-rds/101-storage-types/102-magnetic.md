# Magnetic

"Magnetic" in AWS refers to Magnetic storage, also known as Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) Magnetic volumes. These storage types are designed for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and sceneries where the lowest storage cost is important. Magnetic volumes offer cost-effective storage for applications with moderate or bursty I/O requirements. Though magnetic storage provides the lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types, it has the poorest performance capability and a higher latency compared to solid-state drive storage options.
