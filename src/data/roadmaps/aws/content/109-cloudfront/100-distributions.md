# Distributions

In AWS, a CloudFront "distribution" is the globally distributed network system that helps you to accelerate the delivery of your website, API, video content, or other web assets. These distributions are defined by AWS based on the specified configuration settings. It specifies from where CloudFront gets your files that it will distribute, which is primarily your Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server. Notably, there are primarily two types of distributions you can create: web distributions, which are typically used for websites, and RTMP distributions, used mainly for media streaming.
