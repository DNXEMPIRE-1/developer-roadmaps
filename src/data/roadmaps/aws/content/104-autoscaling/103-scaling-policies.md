# Scaling Policies

AWS Autoscaling supports various types of scaling policies that control how and when to scale. These include target tracking scaling policies, step scaling policies, and simple scaling policies. Target tracking scaling policies adjust the capacity based on specified dynamic conditions, maintaining the target value for the specified metric. Step scaling policies adjust the capacity based on a set of scaling adjustments, increasing or decreasing the capacity within the constraints of the minimum and maximum capacity. Meanwhile, simple scaling policies increase or decrease the capacity based on a single alarm.
