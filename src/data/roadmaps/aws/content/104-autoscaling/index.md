# Auto-Scaling

AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically scales resources to meet the demands of your applications. It uses policies, health status, and schedules to determine when to add more instances, ensuring that your application always has the right amount of capacity. AWS Auto Scaling can scale resources across multiple services and manage the scaling process in real time. It optimizes for cost and performance, and with the help of Amazon CloudWatch, it adjusts capacity based on the demand patterns of your workloads.
