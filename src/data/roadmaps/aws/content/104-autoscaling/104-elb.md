# Elastic Load Balancers

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a load-balancing service for Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments. It automatically distributes incoming application traffic and scales resources to meet traffic demands. ELB helps to ensure that the incoming traffic is spread evenly across your Amazon EC2 instances, making your application more highly available and fault-tolerant. It supports routing and load balancing for HTTP/HTTPS, and TCP traffic. There are three types of load balancers that ELB offers - Application Load Balancer (ideal for HTTP and HTTPS traffic), Network Load Balancer (best for TCP traffic where extreme performance is required) and Classic Load Balancer (provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances).
