# Identity-Based

"Identity-based policies" are one of the types of policies you can create in AWS (Amazon Web Services). They are attached directly to an identity (like an IAM user, group, or role) and control what actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. There are two types - inline and managed. Inline policies are created and managed individually, while managed policies are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple identities. This offers a flexible framework for managing permissions across your AWS resources. These policies are written in a language called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
