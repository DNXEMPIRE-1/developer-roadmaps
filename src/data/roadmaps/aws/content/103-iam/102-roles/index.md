# Roles

IAM Roles in AWS are a form of secure access control that do not directly associate with specific users or groups. Instead, trusted entities such as AWS users, applications or services (like EC2) can take on roles to obtain temporary security credentials for making AWS API requests. The structure of roles lets you delegate access with defined permissions, helping to keep your environment secure. Moreover, because roles yield temporary credentials for navigation within AWS, you won't have to deal with long-term keys.
