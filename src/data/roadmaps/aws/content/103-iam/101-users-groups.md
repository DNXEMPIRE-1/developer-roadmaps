# Users / User Groups

In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), a **Users Group** is a collection of IAM users. Groups enable you to specify permissions for multiple users, making it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a group called "Developers" and give that group the necessary permissions for developing in your environment. If a new developer joins your organization, rather than defining permissions specifically for that user, you can add the user to the "Developers" group to assign those permissions. Remember, each AWS IAM user in a group inherits the permission policies attached to the group.
