# Purchasing Options

Amazon EC2 provides several purchasing options to fit different workload needs. The **On-Demand** option allows clients to pay for compute capacity per hour with no long-term commitments. **Reserved Instances** provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing and are ideal for applications required steady state usage. **Spot Instances** allow clients to bid for unused Amazon EC2 capacity and can provide significant savings if flexibility is possible in starting and stopping times. **Dedicated Hosts** are physical EC2 servers dedicated to specific clients, suitable for regulatory requirements and licenses which do not support multi-tenant virtualization, and **Savings Plans** offer reduced rates for committing to a consistent amount of usage for 1 or 3 years.
