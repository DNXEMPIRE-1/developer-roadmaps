# Elastic IP

"Elastic IP" in AWS EC2 is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.
