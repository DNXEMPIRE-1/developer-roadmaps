# ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS. ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. With simple API calls, you can launch and stop Docker-enabled applications, query the complete state of your application, and access many familiar features like Amazon EC2 security groups, EBS volumes and IAM roles. ECS also integrates with AWS services like AWS App Mesh for service mesh, Amazon RDS for database services, and AWS Systems Manager for operational control.
