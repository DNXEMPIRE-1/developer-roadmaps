# Events

AWS CloudWatch Events is a service that provides a streamlined, systematic method to respond to system-wide changes in your AWS environment. This could range from a simple state change, like an EC2 instance being stopped or started, to a more complex series of conditions. You can set an Event Pattern to monitor AWS resources for specific changes or you can schedule cron jobs. The action resulting from the event pattern can be a Lambda function, SNS notification, or auto-scaling policy amongst other options. Essentially, AWS CloudWatch Events helps you automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events.
