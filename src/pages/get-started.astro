            description="Don't get stuck in tutorial hell. It's easy to get caught up in tutorials and never actually build anything. Tutorials are great for learning, but the best way to learn is by doing. An example of this is to watch a project-based tutorial, code along with the instructor. After finishing the tutorial, try to build the same project from scratch without the tutorial (if you can't, it's okay to go back to the tutorial). Repeat this process until you can build the project without the tutorial. After that, try to add new features to the project or build something similar from scratch."

You don't really learn unless you struggle through it. That said, you won't always be able to move forward without some help. So how do you find that help? First off, forget books. They aren't a great place to start here, because the number and types of errors they can cover is so small. Online is the easiest place to find help. Most devs look for solutions on StackOverflow or just google the error message (if they have one). Other solutions are to find newsgroups or forums dedicated to the language you're using."
